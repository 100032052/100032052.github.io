        <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Heat oven to 400°F. In large bowl, mix 1 1/4 cups flour, the oats and brown sugar until blended. Cut in cold butter, using fork or pastry blender, until mixture is crumbly. (Do not overmix.) Set aside.
</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong>Remove pie crusts from pouches. On lightly floured surface, unroll and stack crusts one on top of the other. Roll to 17x12-inch rectangle. Fit crust into ungreased 15x10x1-inch pan, pressing firmly into corners and sides. Fold extra crust under, even with edges of pan. Flute or crimp edges.

        <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Heat oven to 350°F. Line 13x9-inch pan with foil, letting foil hang 2 inches over sides of pan. Spray foil with cooking spray. Make brownie batter as directed on box. Spread in pan.
</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Bake 22 to 25 minutes or until toothpick inserted 2 inches from side of pan comes out clean. Transfer to cooling rack to cool completely in pan, about 1 hour.
</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Using foil to lift, remove brownies from pan, and peel foil away. Drop 1 cup frosting by spoonfuls over top of brownie and spread. Using sharp knife cut into 6 rows by 4 rows.
</p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Twist cookies open, leaving creme on one side of each. Set aside remaining cookies without creme for another use. Place 2 tablespoons frosting into small resealable food storage plastic bag; partially seal bag. Cut off tiny bottom corner of bag. Pipe small dot of frosting in center of each cookie; place 1 brown Reese’s™ Pieces™ in center to make pupil. Press 2 cookies onto each brownie square for eyes; press 1 orange candy in center to make beak. Place 2 peanut butter cup quarters, cut side-down, at top of brownie for eyebrows.
</p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Let stand about 30 minutes or until frosting is set. Store in airtight container at room temperature.
